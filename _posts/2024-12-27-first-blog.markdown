Hello, this is my own personal blog that I will try to build upon to document my journey in life and keep me feeling productive.

This might not be updated as frequently as I would like, but that is not the point since this is more like a first step into a journey of mine that I would like to start.

My goal with this is to aquire knowledge about myself and skills that I am planning to learn throughout the upcoming years, kind of like a journal, to both distract and build me.

As of now I don't really know where I am heading, but I am grateful for everything that I have, however I feel like I am not really providing much value to my future which is something that I would like to change, I'll try my best to not get caught up on my posts since Time is money.

I am to provide as much value to everyone I meet in my life.
